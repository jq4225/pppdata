## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
ppp_150 <- read_csv("raw_data/sba/PPP_SBA_150.csv") %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  select(address, city, state, zip) %>%
  filter(address != "N/A")

ppp_150

ppp_geocoded <- cxy_geocode(ppp_150, street = 'address', city = 'city', state = 'state', zip = 'zip')
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
