# PPP Disparity Estimation

This  is really messy, but you can run the files in the order of the numbers - i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The raw_data folder is not backed up to GitHub because of size limitations, but contains all of the raw data used. In general, however, data sources are as follows:

All demographic data (e.g. race, median income, high school graduation, marital status, Gini index): 2018 American Community Survey 5-year estimates

Business data: ZIP code is from 2014 ZBP Survey by the Census Bureau, County level is from County Business Patterns survey in 2016

Bank locations: FDIC survey on bank branch locations, updated as of October 1.

Loan-level data: SBA PPP website

COVID data: New York Times

Unemployment data: Bureau of Labor Statistics

State policy dummies: Kaiser Family Foundation state policy tracker

Violent crime rates: County Health Rankings, data aggregated from the FBI

Political leanings: ZIP code level from the Cook Partisan Voting Index, county level from the MIT Election Data Science Lab

Rurality: ZIP code level from the Health Resources and Services Administration, population density on county level from the 2010 Census, cleaned by ykzeng (https://github.com/ykzeng/covid-19/tree/master/data)

Crosswalk tables were from the University of Missouri's Census Data Center and the Department of Housing and Urban Development
